column (i.e., `actual_average_screen_time`).\n","\n","**How do the distributions look like after you implement the three filling methods? (Compare them)**\n","\n","**Answer**: As the mean (3.973) and median (3.715) values are so close to each other that the the filled values actually fall in the same bin, the distributions after filling the missing values using method 1 (filling with the mean) and method 2 (filling with the median) are the same. For method 3 (filling with a random value), the distribution also remains relatively unchanged since this method is akin to a resampling technique, where we're essentially replicating the observed data to fill in gaps caused by missing values."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":76,"id":"d8eb180e","metadata":{"id":"d8eb180e"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Population distribution shape:
